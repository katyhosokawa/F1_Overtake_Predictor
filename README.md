# Formula 1 Overtake Predictor
## Overview

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model to predict when an F1 driver is likely to overtake another car in the following lap.

The dataset is deribed from the official Formula 1 FIA timing and telemetry data, accessed through the open-source FastF1 Python library.

The goal is to engineer interpretable racing features and train a classifier that identifies the conditions most associated with successful overtakes.

## Motivation

Overtaking is a crucial aspect of racing and accurate predicting is essential to strategizing. Understanding which conditions, such as DRS, pace, tyre compound, track, and etc, make an overtake more likely can inform strategist, watchers, and drivers.
